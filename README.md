 E-commerce website page
 ##WELCOME TO MY PROJECT
In my project I have used Html, Css and Javascript.
This is one of my first project.

In my project you should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on your device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Open a lightbox gallery by clicking on the large product image
- Switch the large product image by clicking on the small thumbnail images
- Add items to the cart
- View the cart and remove items from it
