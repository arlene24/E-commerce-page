 E-commerce website page
 ##WELCOME TO MY PROJECT
In my project I have used Html, Css and Javascript.
This is third project.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Open a lightbox gallery by clicking on the large product image
- Switch the large product image by clicking on the small thumbnail images
- Add items to the cart
- View the cart and remove items from it

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### Useful resources

- (https://stackoverflow.com/) - This platform helped me whenever I was stuck with something.

### Continued development

This is my first Frontend Mentor intermediate level challenge and the change of pace was quite evident. I had to deal with a lot more components hence a lot more css and heavier DOM manipulation. I also got to make a carousel for the first time. I still have a lot to learn but I feel like I'm making good progress. I'll be taking on more projects to keep improving and sharpening my skills.
